        <div class="about-item ">
          <h3>Our Beginnings</h3>
          <p> In 1987, tucked inside a converted 19th-century brick textile mill on the banks of
            the River Sheger, our family fired up a single antique stone melangeur and began a
            quiet revolution in Ethiopian chocolate. What started as a weekend hobby—roasting
            small batches of indigenous white cacao beans that grew wild in the southwestern
            highlands—quickly attracted the noses and imaginations of neighbors who followed the warm,
            nutty aroma through the mill’s iron gates. Within a year, the hobby outgrew the kitchen,
            and the Chocolate Factory was officially born, built on the simple promise that every bar
            would reflect the land it came from, the hands that tended it, and the community that
            celebrated it. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-item">
          <h3>Bean-to-Bar Craftsmanship</h3>
          <p> Today the same mill hums with expanded wings, solar panels, and a zero-waste water system,
            yet we still hand-sort every sack of beans, stone-grind for 72 hours in small batches, and
            age our chocolate for a full moon cycle before tempering. Our cacao travels only 480 km from
            forest to factory—one of the shortest “food miles” in the global chocolate world—allowing us
            to pay growers above fair-trade premiums while the beans are still warm from the sun.
            Roasting profiles are tuned to Ethiopia’s unique varietals: bright yellow Amelonado for
            citrus notes, rare scarlet Criollo for honeyed finish, and a purple-forastero hybrid that
            lends deep red-fruit undertones. Each recipe is tested, tasted, and voted on by our
            42-person worker cooperative (half of whom are women who climbed from pod cleaners to head
            chocolate makers), ensuring that the chocolate you unwrap carries the soul of the community
            inside every square. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-item ">
          <h3>Sweet Impact</h3>
          <p> Beyond flavor, the factory is a living classroom: local schoolchildren visit to grind
            their own mini bars, farmers learn post-harvest techniques in our fermentation courtyard,
            and every October we host the “Cacao Carnival,” where 10 % of annual profits are reinvested
            into reforesting riverbanks with native shade trees. Our packaging is printed on reclaimed
            coffee-husk paper, our waste cacao husks fuel the boilers, and the steam that once powered
            textile looms now warms greenhouse tunnels that grow vanilla and cardamom for next season’s
            infusions. Step inside any weekday between 9 and 5 and you’ll hear laughter mixing with the
            slap of cooling chocolate on marble, smell toffee and jasmine in the air, and leave with
            a square that tells the story of Ethiopian soil, Ethiopian hands, and a tiny riverside
            factory that believes business can be the most delicious force for good. </p>
